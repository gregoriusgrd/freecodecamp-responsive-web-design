                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and 
                    lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), 
                    JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic 
                    control over them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, 
                    and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. 
                    Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional 
                    objects; for example:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a 
                        browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions 
                        allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events 
                        such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running 
                        JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate 
                        with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the 
                        application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>JavaScript and Java share some similarities, but they are fundamentally different.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class="bold">JavaScript </span>is a flexible, dynamically typed language. 
                        It doesn't require you to declare variables, methods, or classes in detail. 
                        It has a prototype-based object model for dynamic inheritance and supports functions 
                        as object properties. JavaScript's syntax resembles Java, but it focuses on simplicity 
                        and runtime behavior.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="bold">Java </span>is a strictly typed, class-based language designed 
                        for performance and type safety. It requires you to declare all variables, methods, 
                        and classes with specific types. Java's class-based inheritance and strict structure 
                        make it more complex but also ensure safer and more predictable code execution.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>In short, JavaScript prioritizes flexibility and ease of use, while Java emphasizes structure and type safety.</p>

                <p>
                    You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, 
                    called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A JavaScript identifier usually starts with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). 
                    Subsequent characters can also be digits (0 – 9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, 
                    letters include the characters A through Z (uppercase) as well as a through z (lowercase).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can use most Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. (For more details, 
                    see the lexical grammar reference.) You can also use Unicode escape sequences to represent 
                    characters in identifiers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, $credit, and _name.

            <header>Declaring Variables</header>
            <article>
                <p>You can declare a variable in two ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class="bold">Using var:</span>
                        <p>Variables declared with var can be either <em>local</em> or <em>global</em>, depending on the context of their declaration. For example:</p>
                        <pre><code>var x = 42;</code></pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="bold">Using let or const:</span>
                        <p>Variables declared with let or const are <em>block-scoped</em>, meaning they are only accessible within the block they are declared in. For example:</p>
                        <pre><code>let y = 13;</code></pre>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use let for variables that will change later.</li>
                            <li>Use const for variables that should remain constant.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <header>Data types</header>
            <article>
                <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Six Data types that are primitives:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                            <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. (Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.)</li>
                            <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is not defined.</li>
                            <li>Number. An integer or floating point number. For example: 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                            <li>BigInt. An integer with arbitrary precision. For example: 9007199254740992n.</li>
                            <li>String. A sequence of characters that represent a text value. For example: "Hello".</li>
                            <li>Symbol. A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
