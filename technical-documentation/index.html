                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and 
                    lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), 
                    JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic 
                    control over them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, 
                    and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. 
                    Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional 
                    objects; for example:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a 
                        browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions 
                        allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events 
                        such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running 
                        JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate 
                        with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the 
                        application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <article>
                <p>JavaScript and Java share some similarities, but they are fundamentally different.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class="bold">JavaScript </span>is a flexible, dynamically typed language. 
                        It doesn't require you to declare variables, methods, or classes in detail. 
                        It has a prototype-based object model for dynamic inheritance and supports functions 
                        as object properties. JavaScript's syntax resembles Java, but it focuses on simplicity 
                        and runtime behavior.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="bold">Java </span>is a strictly typed, class-based language designed 
                        for performance and type safety. It requires you to declare all variables, methods, 
                        and classes with specific types. Java's class-based inheritance and strict structure 
                        make it more complex but also ensure safer and more predictable code execution.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>In short, JavaScript prioritizes flexibility and ease of use, while Java emphasizes structure and type safety.</p>

            <header>Variables</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, 
                    called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A JavaScript identifier usually starts with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). 
                    Subsequent characters can also be digits (0 – 9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, 
                    letters include the characters A through Z (uppercase) as well as a through z (lowercase).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can use most Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. (For more details, 
                    see the lexical grammar reference.) You can also use Unicode escape sequences to represent 
                    characters in identifiers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, $credit, and _name.

            <header>Declaring Variables</header>
            <article>
                <p>You can declare a variable in two ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class="bold">Using var:</span>
                        <p>Variables declared with var can be either <em>local</em> or <em>global</em>, depending on the context of their declaration. For example:</p>
                        <pre><code>var x = 42;</code></pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="bold">Using let or const:</span>
                        <p>Variables declared with let or const are <em>block-scoped</em>, meaning they are only accessible within the block they are declared in. For example:</p>
                        <pre><code>let y = 13;</code></pre>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use let for variables that will change later.</li>
                            <li>Use const for variables that should remain constant.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

            <header>Data types</header>
            <article>
                <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Six Data types that are primitives:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                            <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. (Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.)</li>
                            <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is not defined.</li>
                            <li>Number. An integer or floating point number. For example: 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                            <li>BigInt. An integer with arbitrary precision. For example: 9007199254740992n.</li>
                            <li>String. A sequence of characters that represent a text value. For example: "Hello".</li>
                            <li>Symbol. A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>and Object</li>
                    <p>
                        Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful 
                        functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in 
                        the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures 
                        that your application can perform.
